# Welcome to My GitHub Portfolio  

## About Me  
I am a **Business Intelligence Analyst** with a deep foundation in regulated financial operations. I specialize in bridging the gap between raw data and actionable business strategy by automating ETL pipelines, designing dimensional models, and building interactive Power BI dashboards.

## Projects
These projects represent end-to-end BI solutions, moving from automated data engineering to executive-level storytelling.

[Retail Sales Dashboard](https://github.com/data-aleks/FP20_Decmeber_2025_Retail_Sales_Dashbaord) -
This project is an end-to-end performance audit designed to quantify the hidden costs of peak-season logistics by mapping the direct correlation between fulfillment failures and margin erosion. By analyzing campaign efficiency, carrier performance, and return volatility, the study identifies a systemic "Reality Gap" where delivery delays triggered a massive surge in returns


[Credit Portfolio Risk & Performance Insights](https://github.com/data-aleks/credit-portfolio-risk-insights) -
This project is an end-to-end credit risk audit designed to quantify portfolio vulnerability by mapping the direct correlation between aggressive lending leverage and realized capital loss. By utilizing a Python predictive model integrated directly into Power BI, the study identifies a systemic "Risk Ceiling" where default rates consistently breach a 50% threshold across high-leverage brackets. The analysis moves beyond static reporting to isolate £4.29M in latent exposure, providing a roadmap for proactive capital preservation by highlighting exactly where lending becomes a "coin-flip" probability.

[Consumer Complaint Intelligence Dashboard](https://github.com/data-aleks/consumer_complaints_dashboard) - 
An end-to-end business intelligence solution using Power BI, Python, and SQL. This project engineers a dynamic ETL pipeline to process millions of consumer complaints, analyzes key risk areas across products and geographies, and delivers strategic insights to help financial institutions mitigate regulatory risk. It’s a complete solution from automated data engineering and modeling to interactive dashboard design and actionable intelligence.
