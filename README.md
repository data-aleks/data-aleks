## About Me  
I am a **Business Intelligence Analyst** with a deep foundation in regulated financial operations. [cite_start]I specialize in bridging the gap between raw data and actionable business strategy by automating ETL pipelines, designing dimensional models, and building interactive Power BI dashboards. [cite: 52, 53]

[cite_start]My background includes managing high-stakes capital transactions (up to £3M daily) and engineering proprietary tools that have **reduced manual data processing time by 75%**. [cite: 54, 74, 78] [cite_start]I am passionate about transforming complex datasets into clear, diagnostic intelligence that supports operational efficiency and risk mitigation. [cite: 53, 55]

## Projects
These projects represent end-to-end BI solutions, moving from automated data engineering to executive-level storytelling.

[Consumer Complaint Intelligence Dashboard](https://github.com/data-aleks/consumer_complaints_dashboard) - 
An end-to-end business intelligence solution using Power BI, Python, and SQL. This project engineers a dynamic ETL pipeline to process millions of consumer complaints, analyzes key risk areas across products and geographies, and delivers strategic insights to help financial institutions mitigate regulatory risk. It’s a complete solution from automated data engineering and modeling to interactive dashboard design and actionable intelligence.

[Retail Sales Dashboard](https://github.com/data-aleks/FP20_Decmeber_2025_Retail_Sales_Dashbaord) -
This project is an end-to-end performance audit designed to quantify the hidden costs of peak-season logistics by mapping the direct correlation between fulfillment failures and margin erosion. By analyzing campaign efficiency, carrier performance, and return volatility, the study identifies a systemic "Reality Gap" where delivery delays triggered a massive surge in returns
