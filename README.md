# Welcome to My GitHub Portfolio  

## About Me  
I'm a data-driven professional with a strong foundation in financial services, currently transitioning into business intelligence and analytics. With nearly a decade of experience in client-facing roles across financial operations, mortgage consulting, and hospitality, I bring a deep understanding of business processes and stakeholder needs. My background in high-pressure environments has honed my analytical thinking, precision, and ability to transform complex data into clear, actionable insights that support strategic decision-making.

## Projects
These are projects where I’ve gone beyond technical execution to deliver real business value. They combine data analytics, predictive modeling, and storytelling to solve practical problems. Each one reflects my ability to turn raw data into actionable insights that support smarter decision-making.

[Consumer Complaint Intelligence Dashboard](https://github.com/data-aleks/consumer_complaints_dashboard) - 
An end-to-end business intelligence solution using Power BI, Python, and SQL. This project engineers a dynamic ETL pipeline to process millions of consumer complaints, analyzes key risk areas across products and geographies, and delivers strategic insights to help financial institutions mitigate regulatory risk. It’s a complete solution from automated data engineering and modeling to interactive dashboard design and actionable intelligence.

[Credit Risk And Loss Insights For Young Borrowers ( Under 30 )](https://github.com/data-aleks/Credit-Risk-And-Loss-Insights-For-Young-Borrowers) - 
A full-scale business intelligence case study using Power BI and Python. This project identifies high-risk borrower segments, builds a predictive model to classify default risk, and delivers strategic recommendations to reduce potential losses. It’s a complete solution-from data modeling to dashboard design to business impact.

## Challenges and Competitions
These are projects completed as part of many available challenges. 

[December 2025 DataDNA – Animal Shelter Operations Challenge](https://github.com/data-aleks/data_dna_animal_shelter) - 
This project identifies high-risk operational segments, isolates key drivers of resource consumption (ALOS), and delivers strategic recommendations for targeted prevention and field service allocation. 

[FP20 Analytics & ZoomCharts Challenge 33](https://github.com/data-aleks/FP20_Decmeber_2025_Retail_Sales_Dashbaord) -
This project is an end-to-end performance audit designed to quantify the hidden costs of peak-season logistics by mapping the direct correlation between fulfillment failures and margin erosion. By analyzing campaign efficiency, carrier performance, and return volatility, the study identifies a systemic "Reality Gap" where delivery delays triggered a massive surge in returns
